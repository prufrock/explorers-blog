I started playing with [OpenRNDR](https://openrndr.org/) after hearing about it on [Talking Kotlin](https://talkingkotlin.com/openrndr-with-edwin-jakobs/). I saw there was [Kinect](https://guide.openrndr.org/#/10_OPENRNDR_Extras/C02_Kinect) support. Once I had a connect I suddenly found myself want to use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). At which point I promptly mostly wonderfully into a deep, deep rabbit hole of getting OpenCV to work in Kotlin.
